Table 2. Ultimate and proximate analyses of,forest residues and PMSW.,
,a previously studied Portuguese biomass substrate will be used as benchmark. Forest residues,
,"[17] (in pellet form) were selected for this purpose, since it revealed relevant energetic as well",
as economic benefits.,,
,"Prior to the actual gasification process, biomass analysis was carried out in the Laboratory of",
,"Chemistry of the High School of Technology and Management located in Portalegre, Portugal,",
,since biomass characteristics can provide valuable information on how the gasification process,
,will occur. This kind of analysis also provides crucial data to treat the implemented numerical,
model. The instruments used in the performed analysis are:,,thermal gravimetric analysis—
,data for proximal analysis; elemental analysis—determination of biomass composition with,
,"respect to the percentage of C, H, N, and O; humidity—sample moisture content assessment;",
calorific value—appraisal of,energy contained in biomass. Data regarding proximate and,
ultimate analysis for the referred substrates are presented in Table 2.,,
,"It should be noted that regarding the experimental gasification runs, as well as the analyses for",
,"the studied substrates, every run was performed twice in order to avoid measurements. When",

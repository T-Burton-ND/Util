,"Syngas is only formed by H2, CO, CO2, and CnHm and it is at chemical equilibrium.",,,

,Heat losses from the components are neglected.,,,
Some of these simplifications were corrected when the model was expended to deal with the,,,,
heterogeneity of MSW as will be shown in the next subsection.,,,,
4.2. Model validation for PMSW,,,,
"As stated in the mathematical model,",,"to cope with the heterogeneity of MSW,",,the devolati-
lization model had to be restructured.,,"Ideally, one would like to validate the new upgraded",,
"model with the experimental setup used earlier. However, due to unfortunate logistical and",,,,
bureaucratic setbacks this was not possible.,,,,
"To work around the problem, it was decided to validate the model using data collected from the",,,,
literature [30]. Table 7 shows the operating conditions used to validate the numerical model.,,,,
Figure 2 shows the comparison of,,"the composition of obtained gas, estimated by the model,",,
with that measured in the experiments.,,,,
,Comparison between Figure 2 and Table 6 shows that the advancement in the model allowed,,,
,a more complex system to perform in a similar manner and in some cases to predict syngas,,,
